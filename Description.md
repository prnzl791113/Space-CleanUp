My Project is an 3D Space trash collection game which involves collecting the trash and a lot of fun things to play with. The speed is quite fast to be honest but It really helps to clear the level fast.
I was not able to implement the AR functionality, I talked to professor about an error that I was getting, It was not resolved even till the end so I ended up making a 3D Game instead but it looks good so I don't really have much complaints. I was also not able to implement the animations. 

I actively referred to the website whenever I was trying to implement new features, it resulted in the project following the heuristics from start to finish. It made sure that I don't have to change my project in the end to respect the heuristics. To get a bit more in depth, 
Visibility of System Status: Providing clear indicators of the spaceship's current status and progress in collecting trash, ensuring players are always aware of what's happening.

## Nielsen heuristics:
Match Between System and the Real World: Designing controls and interactions in a way that aligns with players' expectations based on real-world experiences, making it intuitive to pilot the spaceship and collect trash.

User Control and Freedom: Allowing players the freedom to navigate the spaceship in various directions, giving them control over their actions and exploration.

Consistency and Standards: Maintaining consistent design elements and interaction patterns throughout the game, enhancing predictability and ease of use for players.

Error Prevention: Implementing mechanisms to prevent common errors, such as collision detection to avoid crashes and loss of progress.

Recognition Rather Than Recall: Presenting information and controls in a way that requires minimal effort for players to understand and use, reducing the need for memorization.

Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Offering shortcuts or optimized paths for experienced players to navigate the game more efficiently, while still accommodating newcomers.

Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: Employing clean and visually appealing interfaces that prioritize essential information, reducing clutter and cognitive load for players.

Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: Providing clear feedback and guidance when players encounter errors, helping them understand what went wrong and how to correct it.

Help and Documentation: Including tutorials to assist players in understanding game mechanics and controls, ensuring a smooth learning curve.


### A list of any free assets used
I used a free spaceship model and also free joystick model. To help with the aesthetics, I also added a sky box template which was free as well.
